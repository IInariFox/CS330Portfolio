Although this course was incredibly challenging, it taught me many valuable lessons that I can apply to my future coding courses. At the beginning, my code was confusing and difficult for someone else to understand, which made it hard for me to build upon my work. However, after 5 or 6 weeks, I finally understood how to organize my code by eliminating repeating lines, commenting thoroughly, and making it easier to read. This experience has motivated me to be more organized and to comment more frequently in my future courses. The weeks leading up to the final project were extremely difficult, and I spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials to complete it. Despite the challenges, completing the project was very rewarding, and I was proud of the hard work that I had put into it, even though there were times when I felt frustrated. To get into more specifics, There were a few things that I had some trouble with. I'll start in chronological order, but also keep it short and sweet. In week one, I found setting up Visual Studio to be fairly difficult. I did not know how to set an environment to be set as a template, i.e, have all of the dependencies point to the correct files and directories, and so for a while I kept needing to redo every setup. Eventually, I asked for help and that fixed everything, but for a short while, it sucked spending around 30 min making sure all of the camera, mesh, shaders, etc. files were being correctly referenced.  Moving on to around week 5, or when we started working on the lighting, I was really confused on how to get that to work. Since I wanted to use three different types of light on my objects, it kind of increased the level of difficulty in programming the scene. Nevertheless, I asked around and kept studying the tutorial as well as looking at the OpenGL documentation, and I found a very basic/rudemntary way of making everything work. The biggest difficulty with light was making sure that the calculation of the diffusion of light and its direction was correct/accurate as well. I made a function that allowed the light to rotate 360Â° around the scene so that users could accurately see the portrayal of the objects under different directions of light, but there was a bug that I could not get rid of/find a solution to that worked in tandem with my current code on three types of light, so I decided to remove that function and fix the light on a specific position. Overall, I was able to apply all of the necessary skills/traits required through the guidelines to meet the requirements of the project. I initially wanted to make an Xbox controller, but that turned out to be way more difficult than I anticipated. 


As someone who already works in the tech, kind of, I work for the IRS as a data analyst, computer science skills are essential for me to reach my goals. My role as a analyst can be challenging, and I have come to understand that the effort I put in is what I get out of it. This class has taught me how to be more organized and to test my work more frequently. Although I have always been organized, this class has shown me how important it is to stay organized, especially when working on large projects where multiple people are involved. These skills will be invaluable in my professional pathway, as I am currently working on a large project that involves many stakeholders, and it can be easy to lose track of things without proper organization.
